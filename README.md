# Game Idea

**Miner Dance**: In Volcano Dance, the player starts out as a small miner trapped on top of a volcano. The goal is to survive as long as possible and rack up as many points as you grow bigger by consuming food for points. 
## Phase 1: 
- [X] Miner Exists: There is a miner on the screen
- [X] Miner Moves: The miner moves left or right whenever the arrow keys are pressed 
- [X] Spawning Food: Food will randomly spawn inside of the boundaries
- [X] Screen Limits: The miner cannot be moved offscreen, I want him to stop when he hits the end of the screen like a collision zone


## Phase 2: 
- [ ] Growth: When the miner consumes food he will grow in size
- [ ] Rocks Spawning: Rocks will spawn in the sky and on top of the miner inside of the boundaries
- [ ] Rocks despawning: Rocks should disappear after hitting the ground
- [ ] Miner Hurt: When the miner gets hit by a rock they should get hurt and lose a heart
- [ ] Timer: The timer should be displayed on the screen on startup


## Phase 3: 
- [ ] Show Stats: The current score and number of lives are shown in the game on the top right corner of the screen.
- [ ] Play Button: A play button and home screen should be displayed that takes you into the game 
- [ ] Power Ups: Power Ups should spawn around that increase player speed and also give them more health

- [ ] Game Over: A message is displayed when the player runs out of lives, or some other visual indicator that the player has lost.
- [ ] Show Stats: The current score and number of lives are shown in the game
